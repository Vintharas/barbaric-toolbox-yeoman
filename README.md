=======================

Sample code for the Barbaric Toolbox Yeoman Series http://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/categories/yeoman/

> From the experience that I have gathered to this date as a web developer, working and playing with stuff like ASP.NET MVC, RoR, node.js, knockout, angular, etc, I have found that **[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)** - *the web scaffolding tool for modern web apps* - provides **the most awesome front-end web development experience** from anything I have ever seen or used **by far**. 

> I haven't worked with it as much as I would've liked, nor as deep as I would've enjoyed, so I thought it was about time to do something to correct that. You are more than welcome to join me: Let's improve our front-end development FU and kick some ass with [the Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
